            <h3>Info about my soccer "career"</h3>
            <p> I play center-midfielder, and sometimes left forward. I have really strong kicks, I usually take corner kicks. I am very fast and I try my best to assist or score goals</p>
            <h3>How I got into soccer...</h3>
            <p>My brother is a very important person in my life, and he is my main role model. I like to do anything he does, sometimes even go past his achievements. He loves soccer and I love it to because of him. He gives me tips for every game. He practices with me and always supports me. That is why I love soccer so much.</p>
