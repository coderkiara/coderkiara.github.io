        <h2>My future</h2>    
            <h3>Highschool</h3>
            <p> I want to go to Millikan high school because I believe it will help me keep up my academics and still give me the “fun” high school experience.</p>
            <h3>College</h3>
            <p>I want to go to San Francisco or Oregon state because I love the scenery there and it is not that far from home. NYU is also one of the colleges I will be looking at for my future because it will help me with my desires of fashion or law. New Mexico or Arizona state college are also great colleges for my future self because they have great law enforcement and academies.</p>
            <h3>Career Interests</h3>
            <p> I want to become a Homicide detective or a Prosecutor because I am very interested in crime, law and I am a very good debater. I would also like to be a fashion designer because I like cultural and vibrant outfits and I enjoy sketching clothing.</p>
